***** always defer package loading

Quoted from [[Use-Package's Loading packages in sequence
][https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package#loading-packages-in-sequence]]:

#+begin_quote
NOTE: pay attention if you set use-package-always-defer to t, and also use the :after keyword, as you will need to specify how the
declared package is to be loaded: e.g., by some :bind. If you're not using one of the mechanisms that registers autoloads, such as
:bind or :hook, and your package manager does not provide autoloads, it's possible that without adding :defer 2 to those declarations,
your package will never be loaded.
#+end_quote

Quoted from [[Use-Package's Notes about lazy loading][https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package#notes-about-lazy-loading]]:

#+begin_quote
In almost all cases you don't need to manually specify :defer t. This is implied whenever :bind or :mode or :interpreter is used.
Typically, you only need to specify :defer if you know for a fact that some other package will do something to cause your package to
load at the appropriate time, and thus you would like to defer loading even though use-package isn't creating any autoloads for you.
You can override package deferral with the :demand keyword. Thus, even if you use :bind, using :demand will force loading to occur
immediately and not establish an autoload for the bound key.
#+end_quote

Quoted from [[Use-Package's Modes and interpreters][https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package#modes-and-interpreters]]:

#+begin_quote
Similar to :bind, you can use :mode and :interpreter to establish a deferred binding within the auto-mode-alist and interpreter-mode-alist variables.
...
If you aren't using :commands, :bind, :bind*, :bind-keymap, :bind-keymap*, :mode, :interpreter, or :hook
(all of which imply :defer; see the docstring for use-package for a brief description of each), you can still defer loading with the :defer keyword...
#+end_quote

Quoted from [[Use-Package's Magic handlers][https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package#magic-handlers]]:

#+begin_quote
Similar to :mode and :interpreter, you can also use :magic and :magic-fallback to cause certain function to be run if the beginning of a file matches
a given regular expression.
...
This registers an autoloaded command for pdf-view-mode, defers loading of pdf-tools, and runs pdf-view-mode if the beginning of a buffer matches the string "%PDF".
#+end_quote

Quoted from [[RYO-Modal's Use-package keyword][https://github.com/Kungsgeten/ryo-modal#use-package-keyword]]:

#+begin_quote
Ryo-modal also provides a use-package keyword: :ryo, which is similar to :bind in that it implies :defer t and create autoloads for the bound commands.
The keyword is followed by one or more key-binding commands, using the same syntax as used by ryo-modal-keys...
#+end_quote

Quoted from [[General's Use-package Keywords][https://github.com/noctuid/general.el#use-package-keywords]]:

#+begin_quote
:general is similar to :bind in that it implies :defer t whenever there are bound commands that can be autoloaded
(e.g. it will not imply :defer t if the only bound command is to a lambda, for example). Whenever autoloadable commands are bound,
use-package will create autoloads for them (though this is usually not necessary).
#+end_quote

Quoted from [[General's :ghook Keyword][https://github.com/noctuid/general.el#ghook-keyword]]:

#+begin_quote
:ghook is intended to be used to add a package’s minor mode enabling function to a user-specified hook, so that when hook is run,
the package will be loaded and the mode enabled. This means that :ghook will usually imply :defer t. While it does not always imply :defer t,
it will add any non-lambda functions to :commands (this is the same behavior as :hook).
Though this is usually unnecessary (the commands probably already have autoloads), it will in turn imply :defer t.
#+end_quote

Quoted from [[General's :gfhook Keyword][https://github.com/noctuid/general.el#gfhook-keyword]]:

#+begin_quote
Unlike :ghook, :gfhook never adds functions to :commands and therefore never implies :defer t.
This is because the functions specified are ones that should be run when turning on (or toggling) the mode(s) the package provides.
The specified functions are external to the package, could be called elsewhere, and therefore should not trigger the package to load.
#+end_quote

Also see [[this comment][https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package/issues/738#issuecomment-447631609]].

Note that I assume that [[chords][https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package#use-package-chords]] also defer and create autoloads.

And in my experience... Not a good idea; much too confusing. Use
[[the arguments here][https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/j2xezg/usepackage_best_practices/]] to decide whether to use this or =:defer <n>= instead.
