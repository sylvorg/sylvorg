;;        Miscellaneous string functions.
;;
;;  You may want to put this in your `~/.emacs' file, to erase the
;;  minibuffer when it is inactive and `minibuffer-empty-p':
;;
;;   (require 'strings)
;;   (add-hook 'pre-command-hook 'erase-nonempty-inactive-minibuffer))
;;
;;
;;  Functions defined here:
;;
;;    `absdiff', `buffer-alist', `concat-w-faces',

;;; Change Log:
;;
;; 2021/03/17 dadams
;;      Use buffer-string, not buffer-substring, for whole buffer.
;; 2020/11/06 dadams
;;     Removed: (non-)empty-name-p.
;; 2019/04/21 dadams
;;     Added insert-string for Emacs 26+ (Emacs removed it).
;;     read-buffer: Added optional arg PREDICATE, like recent vanilla Emacs.
;;     buffer-alist: Use dolist, not mapcar.
;; 2017/02/10 dadams
;;     display-lines-containing: Quote minibuffer-history.
;;     frame-alist: Use code for get-frame-name, not the function (in frame-fns.el).
;;     Thx to Rubikitch.
;; 2105/08/05 dadams
;;     read-any-variable:
;;       Ensure SYMB is not just the symbol nil for default value to completing-read.
;; 2012/09/07 dadams
;;     read-buffer: Use nil for INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD arg to completing-read.
;; 2012/08/21 dadams
;;     Call tap-put-thing-at-point-props after load thingatpt+.el.
;; 2012/08/18 dadams
;;     Invoke tap-define-aliases-wo-prefix if thingatpt+.el is loaded.
;; 2012/04/16 dadams
;;     Added: fill-string.
;; 2011/12/12 dadams
;;     read-buffer: Use internal-complete-buffer for Emacs 22+.
;; 2011/01/04 dadams
;;     Removed autoload cookies from non-interactive functions.
;; 2010/06/28 dadams
;;     read-buffer: Don't provide a default if none given, unless interactive.
;; 2010/02/22 dadams
;;     read-buffer: Update for Emacs 23 (pretest):
;;       Handle read-buffer-function and read-buffer-completion-ignore-case.
;; 2010/01/12 dadams
;;     current-line-string, minibuffer-empty-p, erase-inactive-minibuffer:
;;       save-excursion + set-buffer -> with-current-buffer.
;;     insert-in-minibuffer: set-buffer -> with-current-buffer.
;; 2009/09/09 dadams
;;     (non-)empty-name-p: Got rid of old-style backquote syntax.
;; 2008/05/12 dadams

;;     read-number: Updated for Emacs 22.
;; 2006/08/22 dadams
;;     buffer-alist: Added nospacep arg.  Use t for it in read-buffer.

;;     Added: read-any-variable.
;;     Use nil as init-value arg in calls to completing-read, everywhere.
;; 2005/07/31 dadams
;;     Protected read-number with fboundp.
;; 2005/07/28 dadams
;;     concat-w-faces: Mention in doc string that it is now obsolete.
;; 2005/05/28 dadams
;;     read-buffer: Use other-buffer, if another-buffer is not available.
;; 2004/09/21 dadams
;;     Added buffer-alist (from elect-mbuf.el), so file would be standalone.
;;     Removed require of elect-mbuf.el (circular dependency).
;; 1999/03/17 dadams
;;     Added: read-buffer, read-number, read-variable, frame-alist.
;; 1996/03/26 dadams

cons whose car is a buffer name) as its first arg.  Candidates for

(defun display-in-minibuffer (option &rest arguments)
  "Display ARGUMENTS in minibuffer, preserving their face properties.
This function essentially allows you to display messages with faces.

First arg OPTION determines the display behavior, as follows:

 OPTION values `event', `new', and a `natnump' erase the minibuffer
 before displaying.  Other values do not.  They are intended for later
 use to add to the contents of the minibuffer.

 OPTION values `event', `more-event' and an `integerp' are guaranteed
 to erase the minibuffer at some time after displaying.  Other values
 do not erase it afterward.  They allow you to later add more to the
 current contents of the minibuffer.  Remember that they leave the
 minibuffer with text in it.  They should therefore at some point be
 followed by something that erases the contents, such as
 `erase-inactive-minibuffer'.

 OPTION values `event' and a `natnump' are common, one-shot affairs.
 The other values are only used when you need to combine several
 submessages via separate calls.

 OPTION values `event' and `more-event' block Emacs execution until
 the next user event.  This means, among other things, that such a
 call should always be the last of a sequence of calls to
 `display-in-minibuffer'.

 Here are all the OPTION values:

 If a number: ARGS are displayed for that many seconds (`sit-for'),
      then the minibuffer is erased.  The minibuffer is also
      erased before the display of ARGS, iff the number is >= 0.
 If `event': ARGS are displayed until the next user event, after
      erasing the minibuffer.  (If ARGS = nil, this just affects
      the duration of the current minibuffer contents.)
 If `more-event': ARGS displayed until next user event, without
      first erasing minibuffer.  (If ARGS = nil, this just affects
      the duration of the current minibuffer contents.)
 If `new': ARGS displayed indefinitely, after erasing minibuffer.
      (If ARGS = nil, then this just erases the minibuffer.)
 Else (e.g. `more'): ARGS displayed indefinitely, without first
      erasing minibuffer.  (If ARGS = nil, then this is a no-op.)

If you cannot (or do not want to) explicitly program the ultimate
erasure of the minibuffer, and yet you do not want to block program
execution by waiting for a time elapse or a user input, you may still
ensure that the minibuffer is always erased at the next user input,
by doing either of these (the first is surer, but slower):
    (add-hook 'pre-command-hook 'erase-inactive-minibuffer)
or  (add-hook 'pre-command-hook 'erase-nonempty-inactive-minibuffer)

This can be a good thing to do (but it can also slow things down
considerably).  You may then freely use OPTION values other than
numbers, `event' and `more-event' (e.g.  `new' and `more'), without
fear of indefinite display.  However, user input between `new' and
`more' will then interfere with incremental display.  If you do arm
`pre-command-hook' this way, you can always inhibit erasure
temporarily by rebinding `pre-command-hook' to nil.


The remaining arguments, besides OPTION, may be strings or numbers
\(see `insert-string'), or nil (ignored).

As a special case, they (items in the ARGS list) may also be lists of
the form (FACE STRING), where STRING is a string and FACE is the face
in which it is to be displayed.  In this case, any text properties
belonging to STRING itself are ignored.


EXAMPLE (one-shot, without `sit-for', erasure upon user event):
  (display-in-minibuffer 'event \"a\" \"b\") ; Erase, then display until event.
  ...                                        ;  --> ab

EXAMPLE (multiple calls, without `sit-for', erasure upon user event):
  (display-in-minibuffer 'new \"a\" \"b\")  ; Erase, then display.
  ...                                       ;  --> ab
  (display-in-minibuffer 'more \"cd\")      ; Display (no erase).
  ...                                       ;  --> abcd
  (display-in-minibuffer 'more-event \"ef\"); Display until user event.
  ...                                       ;  --> abcdef

EXAMPLE (without `sit-for', explicit erasure later):

  (display-in-minibuffer 'new \"ab\")     ; Erase, then display.
  ...                                     ;  --> ab
  (display-in-minibuffer 'more \"cd\")    ; Display (no erase).
  ...                                     ;  --> abcd
  (display-in-minibuffer 'new)            ; Erase---same as
                                          ; (erase-inactive-minibuffer).
  ...                                     ;  -->

EXAMPLE (with positive `sit-for'):
  (display-in-minibuffer 3 \"abc\" \"def\") ; Erase, display 3 sec, erase.

EXAMPLE (with negative `sit-for'):
  (display-in-minibuffer new \"abc\" \"def\") ; Erase, then display.
  ...
  (display-in-minibuffer -3 \"gh\")         ; Display (\"abcdefgh\") 3 sec.


NOTE:
 This function is not very useful interactively, especially as regards
 different values of OPTION.  Interactive calls in fact always erase
 the minibuffer first.
 Regardless of this, if interactive, then OPTION is the numeric value
 of the prefix arg, if any.  If there is no prefix arg, behavior is as
 if OPTION were `event': display contents until the next user event."

;;
;;; Commentary:
;;
;;  Use the commands defined here to examine or save the background or
;;  foreground color at the text cursor or the mouse pointer.
;;
;;  After using commands `eyedrop-pick-background-*' or
;;  `eyedrop-pick-foreground-*', the picked color is saved in variable
;;  `eyedrop-picked-background' or `eyedrop-picked-foreground',
;;  respectively.
;;
;;  If you have Emacs 22 or later, all of the functionality provided
;;  here, and much more, is provided in library `palette.el'.  Use
;;  library `eyedropper' instead of `palette.el' if either of these
;;  applies:
;;
;;  * You do not want to use the color palette itself.  You want only
;;    the functionality provided by `eyedropper.el'.
;;
;;  * Your Emacs version is older than Emacs 22 (`palette.el' requires
;;    22 or later).
;;
;;  If you load `palette.el', there is no reason to also load
;;  `eyedropper.el'.  However, if for some reason you do load both
;;  `palette.el' and `eyedropper.el' then load `palette.el' second, so
;;  that its definitions will override those provided in
;;  `eyedropper.el', providing additional functionality for the color
;;  palette.
;;
;;  To use this library:
;;
;;    Add this to your initialization file (~/.emacs or ~/_emacs):
;;
;;      (require 'eyedropper) ; Load this library.
;;
;;    You will also need my library `hexrgb.el'; it is loaded
;;    automatically by `eyedropper.el'.  Get it here:
;;    https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/download/hexrgb.el.
;;
;;  Commands defined here:
;;
;;    `background-color', `eyedrop-background-at-mouse',
;;    `eyedrop-background-at-point', `eyedrop-foreground-at-mouse',

;;; Commentary:
;;
;;  Lets you use key-sequence descriptions that do not bother with
;;  angle brackets: `<' and `>'.
;;
;;  Prior to Emacs 21, vanilla GNU Emacs did not bother with angle
;;  brackets either, but someone around the turn of the century got
;;  the idea that Emacs could not do without them.  So instead of the
;;  `delete' key we now have the `<delete>' key.  And instead of`C-x
;;  M-delete' we now have `C-x M-<delete>'.  "On n'arrete pas le
;;  progres !"
;;
;;  Angle brackets are not needed - why?  Because we already use
;;  spaces to separate keys in a key-sequence description (we use
;;  `SPC' to indicate the SPACE key).
;;
;;  To be fair, it is true that sometimes people have taken the
;;  shortcut when writing about user input of writing, e.g., `M-x
;;  forward-char RET' instead of writing `M-x f o r w a r d - c h a
;;  r'. And if you write `forward' that way to stand for an input
;;  sequence of seven chars, then you cannot also expect `forward' to
;;  stand for a function key named `forward', can you?
;;
;;  Well, yes you can, if the context makes things clear enough.  And
;;  I for one find `C-M-<insert>' butt-ugly (likewise `<C-M-insert>')
;;  - and, more importantly, insulting to Occam and his razor.
;;
;;  So go ahead and go NaKeD - shed your angles.
;;
;;  Here's what you need.  It won't completely purge Emacs from
;;  insulting you with the occasional pair of angle brackets, but it
;;  at least lets you DTRT in code that you write:
;;
;;  * Use function `naked-key-description' instead of
;;    `key-description'.
;;
;;    The former outputs naked key descriptions: no angle brackets
;;    around function keys.  E.g., if KEY is the sequence of events
;;    produced by holding the Shift key while hitting the Insert key,
;;    then `(naked-key-description KEY)' returns "S-insert" (and not
;;    "S-<insert>").  (Internally, this sequence of events is the
;;    vector [S-insert].)
;;
;;  * Use function `naked' instead of `kbd' (which is a function
;;    starting with Emacs 24.3 and a macro before then).
;;
;;    The former allows its argument key-sequence description to use
;;    naked keys, not clothed in angle brackets.  E.g., (naked
;;    "C-M-delete") has the same effect as (kbd "C-M-<delete>").
;;
;;  * Use command `naked-read-kbd-macro' instead of `read-kbd-macro'.
;;
;;  * Use function `naked-edmacro-parse-keys' instead of
;;    `edmacro-parse-keys' (if you happen to use that lower-level
;;    function).
;;
;;  But you can also have it both ways if or when you might need to:
;;  All of these accept an optional argument ANGLES which, if
;;  non-`nil', returns the behavior to the vanilla one, expecting
;;  function keys to be fully clothed in angle brackets.  E.g.: (naked
;;  "C-M-<delete>" t).
;;
;;  In addition, even without an non-nil ANGLES argument, function
;;  `naked' does the right thing for keys expressed using angle
;;  brackets.  IOW, (naked "M-<foobar>") returns the same thing that
;;  (naked "M-foobar") does: [M-foobar].
;;
;;  Enjoy!
;;
;;
;;  Command defined here:
;;
;;    `naked-read-kbd-macro'.
;;
;;  Non-interactive functions defined here:
;;
;;    `naked', `naked-edmacro-parse-keys', `naked-key-description',
;;    `naked-read-kbd-macro', `naked-string-match-p'.

;;; Change Log:
;;
;; 2020/10/13 dadams
;;     Added: naked-string-match-p.
;;     naked-edmacro-parse-keys: Use naked-string-match-p when don't need to set match data.
;;     naked-read-kbd-macro: Fixed typo: \P -> \nP.
;; 2017/04/18 dadams
;;     Added forgotten compile-time require of cl.el, for macro loop.
;; 2013/02/26 dadams
;;     Added (put 'naked 'pure t)
;; 2012/12/01 dadams
;;     Change naked from a macro to a function (like Emacs 24.3).
;; 2012/09/28 dadams
;;     naked-edmacro-parse-keys:
;;       Better fix for M-TAB.  Do not assume that function keys are lowercase.
;;       Handle angle brackets even if ANGLES is nil.  But keep vanilla bug #12535 if non-nil.
;; 2012/09/27 dadams
;;     naked-edmacro-parse-keys: Fix handling of M-TAB.  Function keys are lowercase.
;;                               So M-TAB returns [134217737], but M-tab returns [M-tab].
;; 2011/10/07 dadams
;;     Created.

;;; Commentary:

;; To install, put this file in your load-path, byte-compile it, and add
;; the following to your .emacs:
;;
;;   (load "escreen")
;;   (escreen-install)

;; Inspired by:
;;   * wicos.el, written by Heikki Suopanki <suopanki@phoenix.oulu.fi>
;;   * `screen', written by Oliver Laumann, Juergen Weigert,
;;     and Michael Schroeder.

;; Todo:
;;   * make escreen-menu display list of screens for all frames
;;   * ability to lock window configurations against change or deletion
;;   * ability to renumber screens
;;   * symbolic names for screens (a la wicos.el); partly started
;;   * switching active screen from pull-down menu from menubar
;;   * switching active screen from escreen menu
;;   * persistance of screens across instances of emacs
;;     [look at johnw's work on this; depends on additional non-standard
;;     packages but perhaps those parts can be reimplemented inline.]

;;; Commentary:
;;
;;    Frame configuration that uses one frame per window.
;;
;;  This library is part of One-on-One Emacs, a collection of
;;  libraries that try to make Emacs more frame-oriented and less
;;  window-oriented.
;;
;;  This library sets up Emacs to use multiple frames: individual
;;  frames are used, by default, instead of Emacs windows.  That is,
;;  the default is to use a frame for each Emacs window: one window on
;;  one frame.
;;
;;  You can configure each of the frames defined here.
;;
;;  Default properties are defined here for normal frames and
;;  "special" frames, which show "special-display buffers" (see Emacs
;;  manual for info on such frames).
;;
;;  In addition, these user options control the creation of three
;;  separate, specialized frames:
;;
;;    - `1on1-*Help*-frame-flag' - `*Help*' buffer frame
;;    - `1on1-*Completions*-frame-flag' - `*Completions*' buffer frame
;;    - `1on1-minibuffer-frame-flag' - minibuffer frame
;;
;;  Buffers `*Help*' and `*Completions*' are always displayed in their
;;  own frames.  In addition, if `1on1-*Help*-frame-flag' or
;;  `1on1-*Completions*-frame-flag' is non-nil, then the `*Help*' or
;;  `*Completions*' frame has a special (customizable) appearance.
;;
;;  If `1on1-minibuffer-frame-flag' is non-nil (the default value),
;;  then the minibuffer is shown in its own frame,
;;  `1on1-minibuffer-frame'; this is the only frame to have a
;;  minibuffer.  If you customize `1on1-minibuffer-frame-flag' to nil,
;;  then each frame will have its own minibuffer, as usual, and there
;;  will be no standalone minibuffer frame.
;;
;;  By default, if you use a standalone minibuffer frame, it is
;;  automatically sized to the full width of your display and placed
;;  at the bottom of the display.
;;
;;  If you use a standalone minibuffer frame then option
;;  `minibuffer-auto-raise' can make a difference.  This library does
;;  not change the option value.  A value of nil can make sense for
;;  some window managers that force the refocusing of a frame whenever
;;  it is raised.  If you use MS Windows then this is not a problem:
;;  command `1on1-emacs' sets the Windows-specific option
;;  `w32-grab-focus-on-raise' to nil, so that frame raising and
;;  focusing are decoupled.  So on MS Windows, at least, a non-nil
;;  value for `minibuffer-auto-raise' can make sense.
;;
;;  If `1on1-fit-minibuffer-frame-flag' is non-nil,
;;  `1on1-minibuffer-frame-flag' is non-nil, and you also use library
;;  `fit-frame.el', then, whenever the minibuffer is active, the
;;  minibuffer frame height is automatically adjusted to fit its
;;  content after each command or user event (e.g. each key press).
;;  Options `1on1-fit-minibuffer-frame-max-height' and
;;  `1on1-fit-minibuffer-frame-max-height-percent' define the maximum
;;  possible height for this behavior.  In addition, if you bind
;;  `1on1-fit-minibuffer-frame' to a key (I use `M-up'), then you can
;;  use that key repeatedly to increase the height by one line, even
;;  beyond the maximum.
;;
;;  To help you perceive changes to different minibuffer recursion
;;  levels, the background color of the minibuffer frame is changed
;;  slightly with each recursion-depth change.
;;
;;  If `1on1-minibuffer-frame-flag' is non-nil then you can have the
;;  standalone minibuffer frame be automatically repositioned near the
;;  cursor (point).  To do that, customize option
;;  `1on1-move-minibuffer-frame-near-point'.  Available only for Emacs
;;  24 and later.  For best results use this feature with Icicles.
;;
;;  This library is especially useful if used in combination with
;;  One-on-One Emacs libraries `autofit-frame.el', which automatically
;;  fits frames to their sole window, and `fit-frame.el', which lets
;;  you fit a frame to its selected window manually.  Library
;;  `autofit-frame.el' uses library `fit-frame.el'.
;;
;;  Because Emacs is not really designed to be frame-oriented, there
;;  are many built-in and standard functions that produce
;;  less-than-optimal results when frames, instead of windows, are the
;;  default.  In other One-on-One Emacs libraries, I have fixed most
;;  of these built-in functions to play well with frames.
;;
;;  For more information on One-on-One Emacs see
;;  https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/OneOnOneEmacs.
;;
;;  To use this library, put the following at the *END* of your init
;;  file, `.emacs' (or `_emacs').  In particular, if your init file
;;  contains a `custom-set-variables' expression, then the following
;;  must appear *AFTER* that expression, in order for this to take
;;  into account your customizations of any `1on1-' user options.
;;
;;    (require 'oneonone)
;;    (1on1-emacs)
;;
;;  Initial frame: By default, the initial Emacs frame is like all
;;  other normal (non-special-display) frames; that is,
;;  `initial-frame-alist' effectively uses the frame properties
;;  defined in `default-frame-alist'.  If you would like the initial
;;  frame to be different, set `default-frame-alist' to nil after
;;  requiring `oneonone.el' but before executing `1on1-emacs':
;;
;;    (require 'oneonone)
;;    (setq default-frame-alist  nil)
;;    (setq initial-frame-alist  '((background-color . "White"))); e.g.
;;    (1on1-emacs)
;;
;;  If you want the text cursor to change to a box when Emacs is idle,
;;  then add this line also to your init file:
;;
;;    (toggle-box-cursor-when-idle 1) ; Turn on box cursor when idle.
;;
;;  Info and Customize frames: I recommend that you put the following
;;  code in your init file, so that Info and Customize buffers will
;;  display in their own frames.  Which code to use depends on your
;;  version of GNU Emacs.
;;
;;    (cond
;;     ((< emacs-major-version 21)
;;      (remove-hook 'same-window-buffer-names "*info*"))
;;     ((= emacs-major-version 21)
;;      (remove-hook 'same-window-buffer-names "*info*")
;;      (remove-hook 'same-window-regexps "\\`\\*Customiz.*\\*\\'"))
;;     (t
;;      (remove-hook 'same-window-regexps "\\*info\\*\\(\\|<[0-9]+>\\)")
;;      (remove-hook 'same-window-regexps "\\`\\*Customiz.*\\*\\'")))
;;
;;  Recommended `M-up' key bindings (requires library `fit-frame.el').
;;  (The reason for the conditionals is to handle all Emacs versions.)

;;
;;  By default, `oneonone.el' sets the width of the bottom and right
;;  dividers, which separate Emacs windows, to 2 instead of 0.  This
;;  lets you more easily notice where to drag with your mouse, to
;;  resize windows.  If you use Emacs 24.4 or later then I also
;;  recommend that you consider customizing face `window-divider', to
;;  further highlight the dividers.
;;
;;
;;  Notes on user options defined here:
;;  ---------------------------------
;;
;;  Some non-option variables are used here only as conveniences to
;;  define frame-parameter alists.  They are defined using `defvar',
;;  not `defcustom', because you cannot use Customize to define them
;;  independently of the alist user options they help to define.  The
;;  alists themselves are the variables to customize.  If you want to
;;  change the `defvar' variables individually and then use them to
;;  set the alist variables, then use `setq', not Customize, to change
;;  them, and restart Emacs for their changes to take effect.
;;
;;  Changes to any user options defined here take effect as soon as
;;  `1on1-emacs' is executed, so you can do `M-x 1on1-emacs' to see
;;  their changes (no need to restart Emacs).
;;
;;  User options `1on1-color-minibuffer-frame-on-setup-increment' and
;;  `1on1-color-minibuffer-frame-on-exit-increment' determine how much
;;  to change the color of the minibuffer frame when the minibuffer is
;;  entered and exited.  They are hue increments, and should be
;;  opposite in sign.
;;
;;  They should cancel each other out, so that the color returns to
;;  what it was initially at any given minibuffer depth.  However,
;;  because of the way HSV and RGB color-component conversion works,
;;  the best cancellation does not necessarily occur when these
;;  options have the same absolute value.  And how much their absolute
;;  values should differ depends on that magnitude.  It is best to
;;  just set one of these to an increment you like, and then fiddle
;;  with the other until they more or less cancel.

;;     Renamed: 1on1-default-special-frame* to 1on1-special-frame*.

;; 2013/06/05 dadams
;;     *-frame-font: Changed sizes other than pixels to *, to work around an Emacs 20 bug with
;;                   x-list-fonts' on Windows 7.  See:

;; 2012/08/13 dadams
;;     Fixes to prevent losing input focus to *Completions* frame:

;;         Use save-window-excursion, not save-selected-window (2 places).
;;       1on1-set-minibuffer-frame-top/bottom: Use force-mode-line-update, not redisplay.
;; 2012/08/06 dadams

;; 2012/07/16 dadams
;;     1on1-fit-minibuffer-frame:
;;       Do nothing if last-event-frame is not the minibuffer frame.  Alternatively we could do
;;       nothing if this-command is handle-switch-frame.  Or we could just call
;;       select-frame-set-input-focus at its end to ensure minibuffer frame still has the focus.
;; 2012/03/31 dadams
;;     Wrap count-screen-lines with with-current buffer.  Fixes bug: M in Dired pops up and
;;      selects frame listing marked files - and that frame's screen lines were being used.

;;     1on1-fit-minibuffer-frame: Use count-screen-lines only for Emacs 23+ - see comment.

;;     1on1-emacs: Add/remove 1on1-fit-minibuffer-frame for post-command-hook (if *-flag).
;;     1on1-set-minibuffer-frame-top/bottom: Redisplay.
;;     1on1-fit-minibuffer-frame:
;;       Do nothing unless 1on1-fit-minibuffer-frame-flag.
;;       Test last-command vs 1on1-fit-minibuffer-frame, not vs this-command.
;;       Pass current frame width to fit-frame.
;;       Bind to the 1on1 minibuffer values for the call to fit-frame:

;;     1. 1on1-minibuffer-frame-width: Use 1on1-minibuffer-frame arg for frame-char-width.
;;     2. Don't define width when initially set 1on1-minibuffer-frame-alist.  Instead,

;;     1. Added: 1on1-display-*Completions*-frame, 1on1-display-*Help*-frame.

;;; Commentary:
;;
;;    Frame and window commands (interactive functions).
;;
;;
;;  Summary:
;;
;;    Load this library from your init file (~/.emacs or _emacs).
;;    Add the suggested key bindings (below) to  your init file.
;;    Use `M-up|down|left|right' to move frames around incrementally.
;;    Use `C-S-v', `M-S-v', `C-S-next', `C-S-prior' to move frames to
;;        screen edges.
;;    Use `C-M-up|down|left|right' to resize frames incrementally.
;;    Use `C-x {', `C-x }', `C-x ^', and `C-u C-x ^' to resize windows
;;        incrementally.
;;    Use `C-M-z' or `C-x C-z' to iconify/hide all frames.
;;    Use `C-M-z' in a lone frame to restore all frames.
;;    Use `C-mouse-1' in the minibuffer to restore all frames.
;;    Use `C-mouse-1' in Dired to mark/unmark a file.
;;    Use `C-mouse-3' on the mode line to remove window from frame.
;;    Use `tile-frames-horizontally', `-vertically' to tile frames.
;;    Use `C-x o' to select `other-window' or `other-frame'.
;;
;;  Commands to incrementally resize frames are `enlarge-frame' and
;;  `enlarge-frame-horizontally'.  Sarir Khamsi
;;  [sarir.khamsi@raytheon.com] originally wrote `enlarge-frame',
;;  which he called `sk-grow-frame'.
;;
;;  Note on saving changes made with the commands defined here:
;;
;;    Some of the commands defined here change frame properties.
;;    You can save any changes you have made, by using Customize.
;;    To visit a Customize buffer of all unsaved changes you have
;;    made, use command `customize-customized'.
;;
;;    Frame parameter changes, such as background color, can be saved
;;    for future use by all frames or all frames of a certain
;;    kind.  For that, you must change the frame parameters of the
;;    corresponding frame-alist variable.
;;
;;    There is no single variable for saving changes to parameters of
;;    the current frame.  Instead, there are several different
;;    frame-alist variables, which you can use to define different
;;    kinds of frames.  These include: `default-frame-alist',
;;    `initial-frame-alist', and `special-display-frame-alist'.  The
;;    complete list of such frame alist variables is available using
;;    function `frcmds-frame-alist-var-names', defined here.
;;
;;    Example: Suppose you change the background color of a frame and
;;    want to make that the default background color for new frames in
;;    the future.  You will need to update the value of variable
;;    `default-frame-alist' to use the `background-color' parameter
;;    setting of the changed frame.
;;
;;    You can easily copy one or all parameter values from any given
;;    frame to any frame alist (such as `default-frame-alist'), by
;;    using the commands `set-frame-alist-parameter-from-frame' and
;;    `set-all-frame-alist-parameters-from-frame'.  Those commands are
;;    defined here.
;;
;;  NOTE: If you also use library `fit-frame.el', and you are on MS
;;  Windows, then load that library before `frame-cmds.el'.  The
;;  commands `maximize-frame' and `restore-frame' defined here are
;;  more general and non-Windows-specific than the commands of the
;;  same name defined in `fit-frame.el'.
;;
;;

;;
;;
;;  ***** NOTE: The following EMACS PRIMITIVE has been REDEFINED HERE:
;;
;;  `delete-windows-on' -
;;     1) Reads buffer differently.  Only buffers showing windows are candidates.
;;     2) Calls `delete-window', so this also deletes frames where
;;        window showing the BUFFER is the only window.
;;        (That's true also for vanilla Emacs 23+, but not before.)

The optional args cause tiling to be limited to the bounding rectangle
they specify.  X-MIN-PIX and Y-MIN-PIX are the `left' and `top' screen
pixel positions of the rectangle.  X-PIX-WIDTH and Y-PIX-HEIGHT are
the pixel width and height of the rectangle."

;;
;;; Commentary:
;;
;;    Automatically resize one-window frames to fit.
;;
;;  Functions are provided here to automatically resize each frame to
;;  fit its selected window, when there is no other window in the
;;  frame.  Some standard Emacs primitive functions are redefined to
;;  do this: `display-buffer' (prior to Emacs 23 only),
;;  `switch-to-buffer', and `pop-to-buffer' (prior to Emacs 23 only).
;;
;;  Prior to Emacs 23, automatic frame resizing is also provided here
;;  implicitly for functions `switch-to-buffer-other-window' and
;;  `switch-to-buffer-other-frame', since they ultimately use
;;  `display-buffer', and so the version of it defined here.  (Command
;;  `switch-to-buffer' does not use `display-buffer' - it is redefined
;;  separately here, for all Emacs versions.)
;;
;;  Put the following in your Emacs initialization file (`~/.emacs'),
;;  in order to provide for automatic frame resizing:
;;
;;    (require 'autofit-frame)
;;    (add-hook 'after-make-frame-functions 'fit-frame)
;;
;;  The second line here causes newly created frames to be fitted to
;;  their buffer (window).  Even if you load `auto-fit-frames.el', you
;;  will still need to do this, because `display-buffer' and so on are
;;  not called when a new frame is created.
;;
;;  To automatically fit frames that show a temporary buffer in their
;;  sole window, add this to your initialization file also:
;;
;;    (add-hook 'temp-buffer-show-hook                ; Emacs < 24.4
;;              'fit-frame-if-one-window 'append)
;;
;;    (add-hook 'temp-buffer-window-show-hook         ; Emacs 24.4+
;;              'fit-frame-if-one-window 'append)
;;
;;  User option (variable) `autofit-frames-flag' turns on and off the
;;  automatic resizing defined here.  Setting it to nil turns it off:
;;  (setq autofit-frames-flag nil).  You can also bind it to nil to
;;  temporarily inhibit frame resizing in Lisp code:
;;
;;         (let ((autofit-frames-flag nil))...)
;;
;;
;;  New user option (variable) defined here: `autofit-frames-flag'.
;;
;;  New function defined here (useful as a `temp-buffer-show-hook'):
;;
;;    `fit-frame-if-one-window'.
;;
;;
;;  ***** NOTE: The following function defined in `window.el' has been
;;              REDEFINED HERE:
;;
;;  `window--display-buffer-1' (Emacs 23+) -
;;     Resize frame to fit sole window if `autofit-frames-flag'.
;;
;;
;;  ***** NOTE: The following EMACS PRIMITIVES are REDEFINED HERE:
;;
;;  `display-buffer' (prior to Emacs 23 only) -
;;     1) Use `read-buffer' in interactive spec.
;;     2) Resize frame to fit sole window if `autofit-frames-flag'
;;        (and provided buffer was not yet displayed).
;;     3) Raise the frame.
;;     4) Restore point in buffer - fixes unknown Emacs 22 bug.
;;
;;  `pop-to-buffer' (prior to Emacs 23 only) -
;;     Use the `display-buffer' defined here.
;;
;;  `switch-to-buffer' (all Emacs versions) -
;;     1) Use `read-buffer' in interactive spec.
;;     2) If current window is dedicated, then use another window.
;;     3) Resize frame to fit sole window if `autofit-frames-flag'
;;        (unless BUFFER is already the `current-buffer').
;;
;;
;;  This file loads file `fit-frame.el', which provides the main
;;  functionality behind the automatic frame resizing.  See it for
;;  user options to do such things as customize default frame sizes.
;;
;;  The reason for separating the code here from that in
;;  `fit-frame.el' is to let you load that code but not load the code
;;  here, if you do not want to redefine Emacs primitives.
;;
;;  This file was formerly called `shrink-fit-all.el', then
;;  `auto-resize-frames.el'.
;;
;;
;;  See also these files for other frame commands:
;;
;;     `doremi-frm.el'    - Incrementally adjust frame properties
;;                          using arrow keys and/or mouse wheel.
;;
;;     `frame-cmds.el'    - Miscellaneous frame and window commands.
;;
;;     `thumb-frm.el'     - Shrink frames to a thumbnail size and
;;                          restore them again.
;;
;;     `zoom-frm.el'      - Zoom a frame, so that its font becomes
;;                          larger or smaller.

;;; Change Log:
;;
;; 2011/11/30 dadams
;;     switch-to-buffer:
;;       Pass NORECORD arg to switch-to-buffer-other-window.
;;       Emacs 24+: Same as other versions: use other window if dedicated window.
;; 2011/11/08 dadams
;;     switch-to-buffer: Added Emacs 24+ version (they changed Emacs 24 again).
;; 2011/10-19 dadams
;;     Removed redefinition of pop-to-buffer-same-window (Emacs 24 pretest).
;; 2011/08/14 dadams
;;     Added redefinition of pop-to-buffer-same-window, for Emacs 24.
;; 2011/02/25 dadams
;;     switch-to-buffer:
;;       If BUFFER is nil, use other-buffer.  Thx to Martial Boniou.
;; 2011/01/03 dadams
;;     Removed autoload cookies: non def* sexps, non-interactive functions.
;; 2009/05/03 dadams
;;     Use (fboundp 'window--display-buffer-1), not Emacs version test.
;; 2009/03/08 dadams
;;     Do not redefine for Emacs 23+: pop-to-buffer, display-buffer.

;;     switch-to-buffer: Don't require existing buffer.
;; 2005/05/28 dadams
;;     autofit-frames-flag: defvar -> defcustom.  Added defgroup fit-frame.

;; 2004/10/07 dadams
;;     Renamed resize-* to fit-*, per RMS.
;;     Renamed automatically-resize-frames-p to autofit-frames-flag.
;; 2004/09/21 dadams
;;     Commented-out redefinition of pop-to-buffer.  Removed it from intro.
;; 2004/06/01 dadams
;;     1. Replaced fit-frame-when-display-p, fit-frame-when-pop-to-p,
;;        and fit-frame-when-switch-to-p by
;;        automatically-resize-frames-p.
;;     2. Removed pop-to-buffer and
;;        resize-frame-if-one-window-and-cond.
;;     3. Renamed fit-frame-* to resize-frame-*.  Renamed file.
;;     4. switch-to-buffer: Don't resize if buffer is already current.
;; 2004/05/07 dadams
;;     Updated to work with Emacs 21:
;;       pop-to-buffer has additional arg and doc-string changes
;;       display-buffer has doc-string changes

;;; Commentary:
;;
;;    Extensions to `buff-menu.el', including: new bindings, faces,
;;    and menus; selective column display; and directional column
;;    sorting.
;;
;;    NOTE: Emacs Dev rewrote `buff-menu.el' for Emacs 24.2, so that
;;          it uses `tabulated-list-mode'.  I have not yet updated
;;          `buff-menu+.el' to accommodate this vanilla rewrite, and I
;;          do not know when I might get around to doing that.
;;
;;          If you want to use `buff-menu+.el' with Emacs 24.2 or
;;          later, then you can download the Emacs 23 or Emacs 24.1
;;          version of `buff-menu.el' and put that in your `load-path'
;;          in such a way that it shadows the Emacs 24.2+ version.
;;          You can get the Emacs 23.4 version here, for instance
;;          (combine the URL into a single line):
;;
;;            http://bzr.savannah.gnu.org/lh/emacs/emacs-23/download/
;;             head:/buffmenu.el-20091113204419-o5vbwnq5f7feedwu-197/buff-menu.el
;;
;;          Sorry for the inconvenience.
;;
;;    Note: By default, the buffer menu is shown in a different
;;          window.  If you prefer to show it in the current window,
;;          then just do this:

;;    `buffer-menu-set-default-value'.
;;
;;
;;  ***** NOTE: The following user option (variable) defined in
;;              `buff-menu.el' has been REDEFINED HERE:
;;
;;  `Buffer-menu-sort-column' - A user option now. Numeric, default=1.

;;              has been REDEFINED HERE:
;;
;;  `Buffer-menu-mode-hook' (aka `buffer-menu-mode-hook') -
;;     Fontify buffer and fits its frame.
;;     Add number of marked and flagged lines to mode in mode line.
;;
;;
;;  ***** NOTE: The following functions defined in `buff-menu.el'
;;              have been REDEFINED HERE:
;;
;;  `buffer-menu' -
;;     1. Different help message.
;;     2. Prefix ARG =< 0 now means list (all) buffers alphabetically.
;;        (It used to mean the same as ARG > 0.)
;;        Prefix ARG >= 0 means list just file buffers.
;;     3. Use pop-to-buffer instead of switch-to-buffer.
;;  `Buffer-menu-beginning' - Protected with `boundp' for Emacs 20.
;;  `Buffer-menu-buffer+size' - Use computed width for Buffer + Size.
;;  `Buffer-menu-execute' - Deletes windows (frame) when kills buffer.
;;  `Buffer-menu-make-sort-button' -
;;     1. If same column as last sort, flip direction of sort.
;;     2. Column header face indicates sort direction.
;;     3. CRM is indicated by COLUMN = 1, not by nil COLUMN.
;;  `Buffer-menu-mode' -
;;     1. Doc string reflects new bindings.
;;     2. mouse-face on whole line, not just buffer name.
;;  `Buffer-menu-select' - When Buffer Menu is `window-dedicated-p',
;;                         uses `pop-to-buffer' to display.
;;  `Buffer-menu-sort' -
;;     1. Allow negative COLUMN. Allow COLUMN = 1 or -1.
;;     2. When COLUMN = `Buffer-menu-sort-column', then flip that.
;;     3. Added message at end indicating the kind of sort.
;;  `list-buffers-noselect' - Use longest buffer name+size to indent.
;;                          - Change sort direction if same column.
;;                          - Add sort buttons for CRM and Time also.
;;                          - Sort test is different: no sort for CRM.
;;                          - Go to bob if `desired-point' undefined.
;;
;;  In your init file (`~/.emacs') file, do this:
;;
;;    (require 'buff-menu+)
;;
;;  NOTE:
;;
;;  1. This file MUST be saved with encoding UTF-8 or equivalent,
;;     because it contains an em-dash character.
;;
;;  2. If you byte-compile this using a version of Emacs prior to 23,
;;     and you use the byte-compiled file with Emacs 23 or later, then
;;     some keys, such as `q', will not be defined in the buffer list.
;;     (So byte-compile it using Emacs 23 or later.)
;;
;;  3. Starting with Emacs 24.3, Emacs development changed
;;     `buff-menu.el' so that it is based on `tabulated-list' mode.
;;     Unfortunately, that breaks the `buff-menu+.el' enhancements.  I
;;     have not had the time to update `buff-menu+.el' for
;;     compatibility with Emacs 24.3 and later.  If you want to use
;;     `buff-menu+.el' with Emacs 24.3 or later, you can download the
;;     Emacs 23 version of `buff-menu.el' and put that in your
;;     `load-path'.  You will lose no features if you do that: Emacs
;;     24.3 and later add no enhancements to `buff-menu.el' - they
;;     just base it on `tabulated-list.el'.  You can download Emacs 23
;;     `buff-menu.el' here: http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/ or here:
;;     http://www.gnu.org/prep/ftp.html.  That version will work fine
;;     with Emacs 24.3 and later and with `buff-menu+.el'.  I might
;;     eventually get around to updating `buff-menu+.el' to
;;     accommodate the `buff-menu.el' change, but it is not my first
;;     priority.  Sorry for this annoyance.

Display Options
---------------
Click `mouse-3' for a context-sensitive menu of buffer operations.

These features are available for Emacs 22 and later:

,* You can click a column heading to sort by that column.  Clicking
  again reverses the sort direction.  The current sort column is
  indicated by an underlined or overlined column heading.  Sorting by
  column `CRM' depends on the value of option
  `Buffer-menu-use-frame-buffer-list'.

,* You can resize the Buffer and Size columns using `+' and `-'.

,* You can toggle showing columns Time, Mode, and File using
  `\\[Buffer-menu-toggle-time-column]',
  `\\[Buffer-menu-toggle-mode-column]', and
  `\\[Buffer-menu-toggle-file-column]'.
  You can toggle the Time format using
  `\\[Buffer-menu-toggle-time-format]]'.
  (These re only for Emacs 21 and later.)

Column `CRM':
 `C' shows `>' if you have marked the buffer to be displayed,
           `D' if you have marked it for deletion, and
           `.' for the buffer from which you came (current).
 `R' shows `%' if the buffer is read-only.
 `M' shows `*' if the buffer is modified, and
           `S' if you have marked it for saving.

The other columns are the Buffer name, its Size in characters, the
last Time the buffer was displayed, its major Mode, and the visited
File name (if any).
