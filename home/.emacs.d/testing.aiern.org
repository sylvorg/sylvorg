This is the example org-mode file used for the Denver Emacs org-mode
introduction talk. Everything in this talk should work without any custom
settings or installation with a reasonably recent Emacs version.

Let's start with a headline, this is kind of like Markdown's =#= character:

* This is an example headline

Text can be put into the headline. You can create another headline at the same
level with another * character

* Another headline
Nesting headlines is as easy as adding another start

** Nested headline

** Another nested headline

*** Deeper

** Another headline
**** Deeper...

***** Deeper.....

* Basic markup

You can really go as deep as you want. This is the general building block for
org-mode navigation.

Next, let's talk about some markup

- _underscores let you underline things_
- *stars add emphasis*
- /slashes are italics/
- +pluses are strikethrough+
- =equal signs are verbatim text=
- ~tildes can also be used~

You can generate lists with the =-= character (seen above), or create numbered
ones:

1. Number one thing
2. Number two thing
3. Number three

* Showing and hiding headlines

You can hide the contents of a headline by putting the point (cursor) or it and
hitting =TAB=.

You can also toggle hiding and showing of *all* headlines with =SHIFT-TAB=.

* Tables

Auto expanding tables are one of the coolest features of org-mode, because
tables in Markdown just plain suck. In order to create a new table, you can
start typing it manually, or press =C-c |=, which will prompt for the table's
dimensions.

| First Name                 | Last Name           | Years using Emacs |
|----------------------------+---------------------+-------------------|
| Lee                        | Hinman              |                 5 |
| Mike                       | Hunsinger           |                 2 |
| Daniel                     | Glauser             |                 4 |
| Really-long-first-name-guy | long-last-name-pers |                 1 |

* Org-mode links
:PROPERTIES:...

In an org-mode file, you can press =C-c l= to store a pointer to wherever you
are in the file. Then, with (or without) text highlighted hit =C-C C-l= to make
it into a link.
The example file for Magit
If you don't want to store a pointer (ie, link to a website or something), you
can just hit =C-c C-l= and type or paste the link. To manually create a link, do
something like:

The Denver Emacs Meetup Group

Writequit site

Google's web site

(ignore the *_SRC blocks for now, we'll get there)

#+BEGIN_SRC fundamental
[[http://google.com/][Google]]
#+END_SRC

You can link to files, images, websites, emails, irc, and all kinds of things.

* Various things you can add in headers

One of the most common uses for org-mode is a sort of "task list" or TODO list.
Org-mode supports this by allowing markers in the headline for the state of a
task. Let's look at an example:

** TODO This is a task that needs doing

** TODO Another todo task
- [ ] sub task one
- [X] sub task two
- [ ] sub task three

** Learn about org-mode

*** TODO learn todos

*** TODO learn other stuff

You can toggle each task in a list with the =C-c C-c= keyboard shortcut.

** DONE I've already finished this one

You can change the status of a task by hitting =C-c t= in the body of a task
anywhere, which will prompt for the state to put it in.

You can create as many of these as you'd like, for example (from my own config,
use what works best for you, configuring them is a little out of scope right
here) here's what I use:

*** TODO something that needs doing
*** DONE something that's already done
*** INPROGRESS something I'm currently doing
*** WAITING waiting for someone else before doing anything
*** NEEDSREVIEW there's a PR for this, it needs someone to look at it
*** HOLD this is in permanent hold until further notice
*** CANCELLED I don't need this any more
*** SOMEDAY I'd like to do this someday in the waaaaay off future

A lot of people just use "TODO" and "DONE" though.

** Adding tags and priorities

You can add tags by putting them surrounded in ":" in the headline.
Additionally, priorities

*** Headline with a tag                                                 :org:

*** Another tagged headline                                   :turing:denver:

*** Headline with multiple tags                                   :org:emacs:

Tags are just another way of organizing things.

*** [#A] Important task
*** [#B] Medium task 
*** [#C] Non-important task 

Again you can configure these, or just use the 3 built in ones.
*** TODO [1/3] Task with sub headlines
**** TODO Finish thing
**** TODO Finish that other thing
**** DONE Done with a thing

*** [33%] Task with sub headlines (percent cookie)
**** TODO Finish thing
**** TODO Finish that other thing
**** DONE Done with a thing

* The TODO-planner payoff
:PROPERTIES:...
So TODOs are all well and good, but what is a really neat feature is when you
can easily capture new TODOs and display them easily.

In order to do this, let's configure a couple of Emacs options in your emacs init:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'org)
;; Setup C-c c to capture new TODOs
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c c") 'org-capture)
;; Setup a key bind for the agenda
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c a") 'org-agenda)
;; Set up agenda to know about our file, you can use a list of files or
;; directories here
(setq org-agenda-files '("~/todo.org"))
;; A new template
(setq org-capture-templates
      '(("t" "Todo" entry (file "~/todo.org")
         "* TODO %?\n%U\n")))
#+END_SRC

Now, hit =C-c c= to bring up the capture template list, then =t= to capture a
new TODO item.

Once you've captured a few TODOs, you can try out the agenda by hitting =C-c a=,
which will prompt for what agenda you'd like to see, for now hit =t= to see the
TODO list agenda.

* Exporting an org-mode buffer

Org has a lot of export options, they are all contained behind a =C-c C-e=
export backend, exporting to HTML, markdown, plain text, pdf, etc.

* Show off other features of org-mode if we have more time
Maybe not in excruciating detail, but we can show off the power and cover it in
more detail at a later time:

- refiling (=org-refile=)
- source code blocks
- org-babel
- clocking in/out
- table formulas
- custom agenda views
- capturing notes (not just TODOs)
- publishing projects remotely via TRAMP

- see only tasks that are *not* depending on other *open* tasks
  - see only things that can be done now
- http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-depend.html
- to define workflows (see demo below)

- task dependencies with org-depend ([[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-depend.html][docu]])
  - ~:BLOCKER: an-heading-id another-heading-id~ define blocking task
  - ~:TRIGGER: chain-siblings(NEXT)~  define trigger for setting NEXT
  - ~:TRIGGER: my-heading-id(NEXT)~   define trigger for specific heading to set to NEXT

**** example with triggers and blockers

***** NEXT go for shopping

*** making dependencies explicit: org-edna

- [[https://www.nongnu.org/org-edna-el/][org-edna]]: bit more complex syntax compared to org-depend but also more powerful

- same general approach using ~:BLOCKER:~ and ~:TRIGGER:~ properties

- task dependencies with org-edna:

  - ~:BLOCKER: ids("id:an-heading-id" "another-heading-id")~ same example but navigable id
  - ~:TRIGGER: ids("my-heading-id") todo!(NEXT) scheduled!("++3d")~   define trigger for specific heading to set to NEXT and schedule 3 days later

**** example with triggers and blockers

      between first and second horizontal line (~@I..@II~)
  - ~@>$3=string("")~
    - no value (empty)
    - overwrite the last row (~@>~) of column three (~$3~) with an empty
      string
    - otherwise it would get 1.2 times the value of corresponding
      column of table Income2012v as well - I chose not to want this
      sum in this column
  - ~$1='(identity remote(Income2012v, @@#$1))~
    - values: ~Joe~ until ~sum~
    - copy content of the first column of table "Income2012v"
      (Lisp formula ~'(identity remote(Income2012v, @@#$1))~) to the first
      column in this table
      (~$1~)
    - the "identity" statement prevents calc from interpreting the content
    - this is because I am too lazy to enter all names once again :-)
    - see also [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-hacks.html#field-coordinates-in-formulas][Org-hacks]] for field formulas
  - ~$2='(identity remote(Income2012v, @@#$3))~
    - values: ~10; 24; 17; 51~
    - copy the content of the second column of table "Income2012v" to the
      second column in this table
    - you could skip this column and calculate the values of the next
      columns with direct references to ~remote(Income2012v, @@#$3)~
      as well. However, it is more easy to compare visually if the
      values from 2012 are shown here as well (usability/readability)
    - note: by convention, only the values after the first horizontal
      line are taken
  - ~$3=1.2 * remote(Income2012v, @@#$3);%.1f~
    - values: ~12.0; 28.8; 20.4; 61.2~
    - column three (~$3~) is 120 percent of the values of the third
      column of table "Income2012v" with one decimal place (~;%.1f~)
    - note: 61.2 (1.2 times 51) is overwritten by formula ~@>$3~ from
      above
  - ~$5=$4-$3;%.1f~
    - values: ~-1.0; 2.2; 0.6~
    - column five (~$5~) is the difference between column four to
      column three with one decimal place

Here is another example: how to sum up the numbers of the first column
so far:

#+NAME: Sum-up-of-other-column
| Numbers | Sum of numbers so far |
|---------+-----------------------|
|       1 |                     1 |
|       5 |                     6 |
|      10 |                    16 |
|      50 |                    66 |
|     200 |                   266 |
|    1000 |                  1266 |
#+TBLFM: @3$2..@>$2=vsum(@2$1..$-1)

The formular can be simplified even more by using a column formula:
~#+TBLFM: $2=vsum(@2$1..$-1)~ provides the same result as above.

- all formulas explained in detail:
  - ~@>$>=vsum(@5$2..@5$4)~
    - value: ~1.8~
    - last column in last row (~@>$>~) is the vector-sum (~vsum~) of
      column two to four of fifth row (~@5$2..@5$4~)
  - ~@1$2..@1$4='(identity remote(Income2012h, @1$$#))~
    - values: ~Joe | Alice |  Bob |  sum~
    - column two to four of first row (~@1$2..@1$4~) are copied from
      the corresponding fields of the first row (~@1$$#~) of table
      "Income2012h"
    - see also [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-hacks.html#field-coordinates-in-formulas][Org-hacks]] for field formulas
  - ~@2='(identity remote(Income2012h, @3$$#))~
    - values: ~2012 Income June |   10 |    24 |   17 |   51~
    - the second row (~@2~) is copied from the corresponding fields of
      the first row (~@1$$#~) of table "Income2012h"
    - my guess: "2012" is moved to the beginning of the field most
      probably because it is interpreted as numeric value and not as
      string
  - ~@3$2..@3$4=1.2 * remote(Income2012h, @3$$#);%.1f~
    - values: ~12.0 |  28.8 | 20.4 | 60.0~
    - the columns two to four of the third row (~@3$2..@3$4~) is 120
      percent of the corresponding values of the third row (~@3$$#~)
      of the table "Income2012h" with one decimal place (~;%.1f~)
  - ~@5$2..@5$4=@4-@3;%.1f~
    - values: ~-1.0 |   2.2 |  0.6~
    - the column two to four of the fifth row (~@5$2..@5$4~) is the
      difference of the values in the corresponding values of the
      fourth row and the third row (~@4-@3~) with one decimal place
      (~;%.1f~)
