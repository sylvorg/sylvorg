;;           By: dradams
;;     Update #: 505
;; URL: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/download/simple%2b.el
;; Keywords: internal, lisp, extensions, abbrev
;; Compatibility: GNU Emacs: 20.x, 21.x, 22.x, 23.x, 24.x, 25.x, 26.x
;;
;; Features that might be required by this library:

;;
;;; Commentary:
;;
;;    Extensions to standard library `simple.el'.
;;
;;  See also library `icicles.el' for extensions to `simple.el' that
;;  concern input completion in the minibuffer.  Those extensions used
;;  to be in this library, but they are used by `icicles.el', so they
;;  have been moved there.
;;
;;  Things you might want to do:
;;
;;  * Turn on `hl-line-mode' in compilation and grep buffers:
;;
;;    (add-hook 'next-error-hook 'next-error-buffer-hl-line)
;;
;;  * Change the fringe indicator for `next-error':
;;
;;    (add-hook 'next-error-hook 'next-error-fringe-setup)
;;
;;
;;  Commands defined here:
;;
;;    `set-any-variable'.
;;
;;  Non-interactive functions defined here:
;;
;;    `next-error-buffer-hl-line', `next-error-fringe-setup',
;;    `read-var-and-value'.
;;
;;  Internal variables defined here:
;;
;;    `next-error-fringe-indicator', `set-any-variable-value-history'.
;;
;;
;;  ***** NOTE: The following user options defined in `simple.el' have
;;              been REDEFINED HERE:
;;
;;    `next-error-highlight', `next-error-highlight-no-select'
;;                            - New value: `until-move' (persistent).
;;
;;
;;  ***** NOTE: The following functions defined in `simple.el' have
;;              been REDEFINED HERE:
;;
;;    `edit-and-eval-command' - Bug fix for < Emacs 21: Adds COMMAND
;;                              as a command to `command-history', not
;;                              as a string.
;;
;;    `kill-new'              - Bug fix for < Emacs 21: be sure
;;                              `kill-ring' is non-empty before trying
;;                              to replace kill.
;;
;;    `next-error'            - `C-u C-u' just deletes highlighting
;;
;;  ***** NOTE: This EMACS PRIMITIVE has been REDEFINED HERE:
;;
;;    `set-variable' - Uses `read-var-and-value' to get args.

;;; Change Log:
;;
;; 2015/06/16 dadams
;;     Added: next-error-buffer-hl-line, next-error-fringe-setup,
;;            next-error-fringe-indicator.
;; 2015/06/13 dadams
;;     next-error: next-error-recenter is not defined for Emacs 22, so use boundp.
;; 2012/02/03 dadams
;;     read-var-and-value:
;;       Added optional arg BUFFER.  Use default-value if var is not local.
;;     set(-any)-variable:
;;       Add BUFFER arg in call to read-var-and-value (only for Icicles).
;;       Set default value, if not MAKE-LOCAL.
;; 2011/05/16 dadams
;;     Added redefinition of kill-new for Emacs 20.
;; 2011/01/04 dadams
;;     Added autoload cookie for command set-any-variable.
;; 2009-02-22 dadams
;;     Added: next-error(-highlight(-no-select)).
;; 2006/09/15 dadams
;;     set-variable: Protect custom-variable-p if not defined.
;; 2006/08/03 dadams
;;     No longer initialize kill-ring to ("") - no longer needed, and can cause problems.

;;     Added: set-any-variable-value-history, read-var-and-value, set*-variable.
;; 2005/10/03 dadams
;;     Removed require of icomplete+.el (no longer redefines read-from-minibuffer).
;; 2005/07/28 dadams
;;     Moved all completion stuff to icicles.el:
;;       choose-completion-string, completion-setup-function, switch-to-completions.
;;     No longer require icicles.el.
;;     Removed: completion-reference-buffer.
;;     completion-setup-function:
;;       Renamed icicle-completing-read-prompt-suffix to icicle-prompt-suffix.
;; 2005/07/15 dadams
;;     choose-completion-string, completion-setup-function: Updated for Emacs 21+.
;; 2005/07/10 dadams
;;     Renamed: command-calling-for-completion -> icicle-cmd-calling-for-completion.
;; 2004/09/21 dadams
;;     Only redefine edit-and-eval-command & choose-completion-string if prior to Emacs 21.
;; 1999/03/17 dadams
;;     1. choose-completion-string: Added doc string.  Updated to correspond to
;;        Emacs 34.1 version.
;;     2. completion-setup-function: diff prompt setups.  face1 & face2 tests.
;;     3. Added: switch-to-completions.
;; 1996/06/14 dadams
;;     kill-ring: Bug fix: `mouse-save-then-kill' expects a consp, so ensure this.
;; 1996/04/26 dadams
;;     Put escaped newlines on long-line strings.

 negative means move back to previous error messages.
Plain `\\[universal-argument]' means reparse the error message buffer and start at the
first error.
`C-u C-u' means just delete the highlight overlay (if any).

The RESET argument specifies that we should restart from the beginning.

`\\[next-error]' normally uses the most recently started
compilation, grep, or occur buffer.  It can also operate on any
buffer with output from the \\[compile], \\[grep] commands, or,
more generally, on any buffer in Compilation mode or with
Compilation Minor mode enabled, or any buffer in which
`next-error-function' is bound to an appropriate function.
To specify use of a particular buffer for error messages, type
`\\[next-error]' in that buffer when it is the only one displayed
in the current frame.

Once `\\[next-error]' has chosen the buffer for error messages, it
runs `next-error-hook' with `run-hooks', and stays with that buffer
until you use it in some other buffer which uses Compilation mode
or Compilation Minor mode.

;;  `count-windows' -
;;     Only use arg MINIBUF if current frame has a minibuffer.

;;  `quit-window' - Call `delete-window' inside `condition-case'.

;;  This file should be loaded after loading the standard GNU file

;;; Change Log:

;; 2014/10/25 dadams
;;     special-display-popup-frame: Protect set-window-prev-buffers with fboundp.
;; 2014/02/16 dadams
;;     special-display-popup-frame:
;;       Use vanilla Emacs 24 code for display-buffer-record-window,
;;       set-window-buffer, etc.  Fixes Emacs bug #16768.
;; 2012/10/15 dadams
;;     Do not redefine quit-window for Emacs 24+, so do not delete frame for NEWS.
;;       Thx to Martin Rudalics.
;; 2012/09/10 dadams
;;     special-display-popup-frame: Protect fit-frame call with fboundp.
;; 2012/08/31 dadams
;;     special-display-popup-frame:
;;       save-selected-window -> save-window-excursion -
;;         fixes bug that moved point to bob when use pp-eval-last-sexp.
;; 2012/08/25 dadams
;;     special-display-popup-frame:
;;       Put back missing (set-window-buffer window buffer) - removed accidentally.
;;       Call fit-frame with the buffer's WINDOW selected.  Inhibit before then.
;; 2012/08/11 dadams
;;     special-display-popup-frame:
;;       Adapt redefinition for all Emacs versions.
;;       Do not raise or fit frame if (car ARGS) is a FUNCTION.  Make it do the work.
;; 2012/08/10 dadams
;;     special-display-popup-frame: Updated for latest Emacs 24.
;; 2011/06/29 dadams
;;     Added: special-display-popup-frame (for Emacs 24+).
;;     Require fit-frame.el (for Emacs 24+).
;; 2011/01/04 dadams
;;     Added autoload cookie for command quit-window.
;; 2008/02/27 dadams
;;     Added redefinition of quit-window.
;; 1996/01/25 dadams
;;     count-windows: Returned to original meaning of arg,
;;                    but only use arg ifframe has a minibuffer.

;;
;; look like this:
;;
;;  /private/rgiardin/lispHome/emacs.config:
;;  used 1264 available files
;;
;;  [...] ..
;;  [...] dired-details.el
;;  [...] my-really-really-long-I-mean-really-long-filename.el
;;  [...] linked-file.el -> [...]
;;
;; The function `dired-details-toggle' will toggle details on and off.
;;
;;
;; INSTALLATION:
;;
;; To apply `dired-details-hide' to all new dired buffers, add the
;; following to your .emacs:
;;
;; (require 'dired-details)
;; (dired-details-install)
;;
;; This also binds the following keys in dired buffers:
;;
;;   ) - dired-details-show
;;   ( - dired-details-hide
;;
;; CHANGES:
;;
;; * 1.3.2: Added sr-mode to dired-details-hide function to make it word with
;;          Sunrise Commander
;; * 1.3.1: Allow "misc lines (total used, find-dired statuses, etc)" to be hidden;
;;          suggested by Chris Poole
;; * 1.3: dired-details-toggle and customization support added by Klaus Berndl
;; * 1.2.4: Setup hide and show keybindings earlier than the first hide.
;; * 1.2.3: add dired-details-initially-hide customization as suggested by Harold Maier
;; * 1.2.2: extensive change to support subdirs in dired buffers
;; * 1.2.1: respect current hidden state (not initial state) when inserting subdirs
;;
;; TODO:
;; * add a hook for dired-add-file to hide new entries as necessary
;;
